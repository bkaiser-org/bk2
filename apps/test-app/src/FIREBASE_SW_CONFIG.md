# Firebase Service Worker Configuration

The `firebase-messaging-sw.js` file requires Firebase configuration to initialize the Firebase app in the service worker context.

## Security Approach

To avoid hardcoding sensitive Firebase credentials directly in the service worker file, we use a dynamic configuration approach:

1. **Build-time Generation**: During the build process, the `set-env.js` script generates a `firebase-config.js` file that contains the Firebase configuration loaded from environment variables.

2. **Service Worker Import**: The `firebase-messaging-sw.js` file imports this generated configuration using `importScripts('./firebase-config.js')`.

3. **Gitignore**: The `firebase-config.js` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data from being committed.

## How It Works

1. When you run the build or the `set-env` target, the script:
   - Reads Firebase configuration from `FIREBASE_WEBAPP_CONFIG` environment variable
   - Generates `apps/{app-name}/src/firebase-config.js` with the configuration
   - This file is then available to the service worker at runtime

2. The service worker loads this configuration:
   ```javascript
   importScripts('./firebase-config.js');
   firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   ```

3. The generated `firebase-config.js` is automatically copied to the build output and served alongside other static assets.

## Local Development

The `firebase-config.js` files are generated automatically when you run:
- `nx run test-app:set-env`
- `nx run scs-app:set-env`
- Or any build command that depends on these targets

Make sure your environment variables are properly set (either in `.env` file or as environment variables) before running the build.

## Important Notes

- **Never commit** `firebase-config.js` files to version control
- The files are regenerated on each build with current environment configuration
- In production, the configuration comes from Cloud Secrets via `FIREBASE_WEBAPP_CONFIG`
- The same Firebase configuration is used for both the main app and the service worker

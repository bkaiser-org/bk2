# util-core

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev). It contains utility functions with very few external dependencies.
util-core can be used by the node.js backend (cloud functions), because it is not dependent on angular or ionic.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test util-core` to execute the unit tests.

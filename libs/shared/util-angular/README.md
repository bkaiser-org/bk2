# shared-util-angular

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev). It contains utility functions with only few basic dependencies.
It can be used on the client side, but not by the node.js backend, because it has dependencies to angular and ionic.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test shared-util-angular` to execute the unit tests.
